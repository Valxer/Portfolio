# Three.js  Playground

A webpage created in the sole purpose of playing with the Three.js library to understand the gist of it.  
Not much to see but the way i usually try libraries to understand how to use them instead of just blindly following a tutorial without grasping any of the actual possibilities.

## Objectives
+ Creation of a simple 3D object
+ Understanding the principles of scene, camera, renderer, geometry and mesh
+ Using dat.GUI to enable dynamic change of object dimensions
+ Using gsap to create dynamic animations


## Technologies
+ Vue.js 3
+ Vite template
+ Three.js
+ dat.GUI
+ gsap
+ SASS

## Access
The website is accessible by [`clicking here`](https://three-js-playground.netlify.app/) or at https://three-js-playground.netlify.app/

## Getting the web page without the website
1. Clone the repository with ``git clone https://github.com/Valxer/Three.js-Playground.git``
2. Open the repository with VSCode
3. Open a terminal in VSCode :  
	* Type ``npm install`` to install all the dependencies
	* Type ``npm run dev`` to launch the app. The window should self-open. Otherwise the console should give you the URL under the section "Local" (by default http://localhost:3000/)
4. Enjoy !
